        "\n",
        "The advantage of regularization versus plain least squares has to do with the bias-variance trade off.

The difference between the two regularizations is the form of this penalty term. For Ridge, we have penalty term as the beta coefficients *squared*. For Lasso, we have the *absolute value*.
